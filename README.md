### Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. To setup the API, cd into the `wallstreet-web-services` dir and do the following:
    * First, you will probably need to install flask and flask-restful
        * `pip install flask`
        * `pip install flask-restful`
    * `python api.py`
    * The API is now running on port `5000`
3. In the `wallstreet-ui` dir, run `yarn` and then `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
    * The app is now running on port `3000`
